### Privacy

The meteroid app stores a few things permanently on your device
("permanently" meaning, until you uninstall the app or clear its data):
 * the URL of your chosen mete instance
 * your user ID (just a number that identifies you)
 * your last five used items

Additionally, some data may be cached temporarily:
 * your avatar
 * the avatars of other users
 * the images of drinks

The rest of the data is kept in your mete instance. Please check its terms
and make sure you trust its operators:
 * your chosen name (this can just be a nickname)
 * your e-mail address (optional)
 * your usage history (optional)
